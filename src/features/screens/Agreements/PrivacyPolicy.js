                <h3>Sharing Information outside Cashingames</h3>
                <p>Cashingames may be required to share user information with Service Partners performing tasks on our behalf and with other companies, organizations, government bodies, and individuals outside Cashingames where we have a legitimate legal reason for doing so (for example, in connection with any merger or acquisition) or <br />
                Whenever legally possible, we ensure we undertake measures to protect the information we share by imposing contractual privacy and security safeguards on the recipient of the information. In some cases, however, it’s not possible for us to do so — for example, when we have a legal obligation to disclose information to a government authority and that government authority isn’t willing to enter into such contractual safeguards.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Information Security</h3>
                <p>We take appropriate administrative, technical and organizational measures designed to help protect information about users from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a means to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this confidential. We ask you not to share your security details with anyone. <br />
                Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. <br />
                In each case of an information breach, we carry out an investigation, quickly inform regulators (if required), and users of the breach, and be specific with respect to what information was impacted and how the issue will be addressed moving forward, within 72 hours of identifying the breach.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Information Storage</h3>
                <p>We store and process information in a secure and encrypted manner at cloud storage in a manner compliant with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (“NDPR”) of 2019. We do not store information beyond the time prescribed by law unless we have a legitimate legal reason to store information for a longer period – for example, where we are under a binding legal order not to destroy information.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
                <p>Unless required by law, we never disclose PII without seeking and obtaining express written consent from the user prior to disclosure. When seeking consent, the purpose of the disclosure must be explicitly stated to enable the user to make an informed disclosure prior to granting consent. If consent is obtained, we shall take necessary measures to limit disclosure to the scope/purpose necessitating the disclosure. Users are at liberty to refuse consent and it will not hinder the user from accessing our Platform.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Use of PPII for Marketing and Advertising Purposes</h3>
                <p>We never use PII for marketing and advertising purposes unless express written consent is sought and obtained from the user prior to publishing the advert or campaign. Users are at liberty to refuse consent and it will not hinder the user from accessing our Platform. If consent is obtained, we shall take necessary measures to limit disclosure of identifiable information by anonymisation, where feasible, and limiting the scope of the information disclosed.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The Use of Service Partners for Processing PII</h3>
                <p>As stated earlier, we use Service Partners for processing payment. We may also utilise the services of subcontractor(s) to for other services requiring the processing of PII. Each Service Partner is under the same obligation(s) to handle PII as would be expected of us. We shall inform the users where there will be processing of PII by a Service Partner. <br />
                We protect the security of PII processed by Service Partner(s) by ensuring that the processes utilized by Service Partner(s) specify the minimum technical, organisational standards and information security required, as captured in the agreements between us and the Service Partner(s).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Handling PII Security Breaches</h3>
                <p>Although we implement the highest measures to protect PII, security breaches may occur despite best security practices. In the event of a breach, we shall promptly notify the user via email provided in their account of the nature of the breach and remedial measures taken to minimize the effect of the breach. If we determine that the supervisory authority needs to be informed, the supervisory authority shall be informed in writing within 72 hours of the breach.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. <br />
